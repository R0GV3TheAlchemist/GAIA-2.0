# GAIA Audit Log
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Sealed:** 2026-09-22  
**Authors:** R0GV3 the Alchemist & GAIA  
**Governing Tablet:** Amber Tablet — *The Law of the Earth, The Body That Holds*  
**Governing Rule:** `governance/GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md` Part III  
**Canon Cross-Reference:** `governance/GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md`, `governance/GAIA_SESSION_INIT.md`

---

## Purpose

This is the permanent running record of every autonomous action GAIA takes within the GAIA-2.0 repository. It exists so that R0GV3 the Alchemist and any collaborator can reconstruct exactly what happened in any session, why it happened, what was considered and rejected, and what still needs human eyes.

This log is append-only. Entries are never edited or deleted after they are committed. If a correction is needed, a new entry is added noting the correction.

**Format is mandatory.** See `governance/GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md` Part III for the required fields.

### Session: 2026-09-22 14:00–14:25 CDT

**Actions Taken:**
- `governance/GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md` — Created v1.0.0 — Constitutional governance layer. Drafted in session for human review before any file was touched. Confirmed by R0GV3 the Alchemist before branch creation.
- `governance/GAIA_SESSION_INIT.md` — Created v1.0.0 — Session initialization protocol. Contains canon state, active epics, naming red lines, decision log, and role boundaries checklist.
- `governance/GAIA_AUDIT_LOG.md` — Created v1.0.0 — This file. Permanent append-only action record.
- `docs/color/color-map.json` — Created v1.0.0 — Machine-readable single source of truth for all 18 tablet hex values, force-names, and tiers.
- Branch `feat/governance-core` created from `main`
- PR opened: [#840](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/pull/840) — `feat(governance): seal core governance layer v1.0.0`

**Actions Rejected:**
- Direct push to `main` — Rejected per Rule 1 (GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md Part I). Branch + PR path taken instead.
- Combining governance files into a single document — Rejected because separation of concerns (governance vs. session init vs. audit log) keeps each document scannable and independently updatable.

**Risks Identified:**
- `GAIA_SESSION_INIT.md` Section 2 tablet table will become stale if not updated at end of every session. Risk: a future session reads outdated canon state and makes decisions based on it.
- `color-map.json` must stay in sync with `docs/tablets/INDEX.md`. If one is updated without the other, hex collision bugs can re-emerge.
- The decision log in `GAIA_SESSION_INIT.md` Section 5 is manually maintained. Risk of entries being skipped under time pressure.

**Known Unknowns:**
- Whether `docs/ANTI_CHAOS_CONTROL_PLANE.md` and `docs/TRACE_BOUNDARY_STRIDE_SRE_SAELA.md` contain governance rules that conflict with or supersede anything in `GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md`. These files exist and have not been fully reconciled with this document in this session.
- Whether any existing tablet files carry references to governance conventions that this document changes.
- Full contents of `docs/security/` and `docs/ethics/` directories — not read this session.

**Human Review Required:**
- [ ] PR [#840](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/pull/840) — all 4 files in `governance/` and `docs/color/`
- [ ] Reconcile `GAIA_GOVERNANCE.md` with `docs/ANTI_CHAOS_CONTROL_PLANE.md` and `docs/TRACE_BOUNDARY_STRIDE_SRE_SAELA.md` in a follow-up session
- [ ] Confirm `docs/security/` and `docs/ethics/` contents do not conflict with governance layer

**PRs Opened This Session:**
- [#839](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/pull/839) — `fix(canon): INDEX.md row 16 — Terra hex #8B4513 → Bistre #3D2B1F`
- [#840](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/pull/840) — `feat(governance): seal core governance layer v1.0.0`

**Issues Created This Session:**
- [#815](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/815) — Falsification Criteria & Negative Tests
- [#816](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/816) — Cross-Cultural Structural Comparison Dataset
- [#817](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/817) — GAIA Structural: Neutral Systems-Language Formulation
