# GAIA 2.0 + GAIAN 2.0: Perpetual Infinite Context
## Blueprint 59: The Continuity Substrate
### September 9, 2026 — Version 0.6 (canonical)

**Write target:** [R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0)
**License:** Apache-2.0
**Issues:** [#215](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/215) (epic), [#219](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/219) (spec)

## The three contracts

**Perpetual Infinite Context**
The system continuously captures, processes, and indexes everything the user sees, hears, reads, and types across all sessions without lagging the system.

**Vectorized Episodic Memory**
A semantic memory layer that allows the user to query their entire digital history using vague, natural language.

**Dynamic State Hydration**
The ability to pause any complex workflow, close all windows, and instantly recreate the exact mental state, open files, and AI context weeks later in a single prompt.

Not: unbounded transformer windows, JSON dumps into a vector DB, or replaying weeks of chat. Infinite history, bounded working set.

---

## Placement

L2.5 Continuity (Capture Bus, Episode Index, Snapshot Store) sits between SFS (L2) and MemOS (L3). Complements Blueprint 49 (Mi-Memory) and Blueprint 58 (MemOS). Does not replace them.

```
L3  MemOS
L2.5 CONTINUITY — Capture Bus | Episode Index | Snapshot Store
L2  Semantic File System
```

## Architecture

### Capture Bus
Background ring. Drop oldest if full. Never stall the UI. Accessibility tree first; OCR only if empty. Audio/keys/clipboard/files/agent traces opt-in. Pipeline: capture → redact secrets/CARE → segment → embed async → commit. Idle CPU under 3%. Gates: Invariant 0.3, lock-screen halt, Invariant 0.8.

### Episode Index
Episode = time, device, modality, redacted text, embedding, importance, optional snapshot_id. Query: temporal anchor → dense+BM25 → contiguity → graph hop → bounded assemble. Vector store is the index, not the memory architecture.

### Snapshot Store
Immutable: mental_state, workspace W_t, ai_context, resume_contract (current_step, state_delta). Hydrate: resolve → freeze current (undo) → restore files/layout → load agent+MemCubes → apply state_delta **before** inference. Do not replay idle chat. Scale agents to zero while paused.

EM-LLM is the episodic spine. MemGPT/MemOS are paging. Versioned workspace hydrates files, not chat.

## Daemon / MVP

```
remember_life()        # Capture Bus; never blocks UI
ask_history(vague)     # Episode Index; top-k only
pause_world(label)     # freeze; scale to zero
restore_world(prompt)  # hydrate; state_delta before inference
```

| Week | Ship |
|------|------|
| 1 | Accessibility logger + ring + SQLite (text + time) |
| 2 | Local embeddings + FTS5; `ask_history` |
| 3 | Snapshot files/hashes/git HEAD/current_step; `restore_world` |
| 4 | Sleep/wake; export + cryptographic delete of one day |

Success: 4h capture under 3% CPU; vague recall hits the right file; next-day one-prompt restore of files + step.

## Important work

Do this next. Track on existing #215 / #219 only.

1. **Consent first** — every capture flag default false; lock-screen halt; CARE freeze before any logger.
2. **Implement `gaia-memos/continuity/`** — the four calls above; drop frames rather than stall.
3. **Map onto MemOS cubes** — Capture → plaintext MemCubes; snapshots → activation; frequent episodes may migrate parametric (#219).
4. **Forget/correct** — Invariant 0.8; forgotten item not retrievable; audit trace (#219 acceptance).
5. **Migration fixture** — identity survives harness A→B without a new UUID (#215 acceptance).
6. **Hydration without hallucination** — `state_delta` before inference; never infer `current_step` from chat.
7. **Adapters, not forks** — Screenpipe/Mem0/Graphiti/Letta/MIRIX behind Apache-2.0 interfaces.
