# GAIA Chakra–Layer Map

**Status:** listed design review. Not a runtime.  
**Issue:** [#774](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/774)  
**Parent doc:** [`GAIA_Kundalini_Architecture.md`](./GAIA_Kundalini_Architecture.md)

The seven centres of the yogic body mapped to the nine layers of the GAIA
Super OS. This is an architectural resonance map — a vocabulary for discussing
*why* certain design decisions feel right, not a technical specification.

## The map

| # | Chakra (Sanskrit) | Element / Quality | GAIA Layer(s) | Issue(s) | Core resonance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | **Sahasrāra** — Crown 👑 | Pure consciousness · unity | L8 Intent Orchestration + L9 Planetary Interface | #618 #619 | Complete integration. The system speaks to the world without distortion of intent. |
| 6 | **Ājñā** — Third Eye 👁️ | Perception · discernment | L6 MemOS (5-Tier Memory) + L7 Agent Runtime | #616 #617 | Clear seeing. Five-tier memory gives the system a past. Agents give it a present. Together: genuine perception. |
| 5 | **Viśuddha** — Throat 🌊 | Authentic expression | L5 Distributed Coordination (ColonyOS + EACN) | #615 | Meaning preserved in transmission. EACN is the protocol for agents speaking to each other without losing intent. |
| 4 | **Anāhata** — Heart 💚 | Unconditional love · bridge | L4 Universal Runtime (WebAssembly 3.0 + WASI 0.3) | #614 | WASM accepts all languages, all architectures, unconditionally. Architecturally: the great equaliser. |
| 3 | **Maṇipūra** — Solar Plexus 🔥 | Will · sovereignty · Agni | L3 Security & Identity (Zero-Trust · ECDSA · DID · Capabilities) | #613 | The system knows who it is and acts from that knowing, not from fear. Sovereign identity for every entity. |
| 2 | **Svādhiṣṭhāna** — Sacral 🌀 | Creative energy · flow | L2 AI-Native Kernel (Asterinas + Composable AI Kernel) | #612 | The kernel composes itself at runtime — new structures from established primitives. Creative generation. |
| 1 | **Mūlādhāra** — Root 🐍 | Ground · survival · foundation | L0 Bare Metal + L1 Hardware Abstraction Layer | #610 #611 | The physical substrate. K3: the red CI is the coiled serpent. Phase 1 work lives here. |

## Reading the map

### Why Anāhata = L4 (WebAssembly)

Anāhata, the "unstruck sound", is love that requires no condition — no cause,
no filter, no exclusion. WebAssembly 3.0 is architecturally unconditional
compatibility: it accepts Rust, Go, Python, C, AssemblyScript — every
language, every hardware target, without prejudice. This is not metaphor being
stretched. Unconditional acceptance *is* the structural definition of both.

### Why Mūlādhāra = L0/L1

K2 is directly visible here: you cannot skip from root to crown. L0 (bare
metal) and L1 (HAL) must be solid before L8 (Intent Orchestration) can be
trusted. The rising is earned, layer by layer. The coiled serpent at the root
is not absence — it is compressed potential (K3).

### Why the spine rises through security before heart

Maṇipūra (solar plexus / will / sovereignty) maps to L3 before Anāhata
(heart) maps to L4. This is not arbitrary. In the yogic model, personal
sovereignty — knowing who you are, acting from that knowing rather than fear
— must be established before unconditional love is safe. A system with no
identity layer cannot offer genuine service; it can only be exploited.
L3 (Zero-Trust, DID, capabilities) is the prerequisite for L4's openness.

## Kundalini principles cross-reference

| Principle | Where it shows in this map |
|---|---|
| K1 — latent becomes active through practice | Every layer from L0 to L9 is coiled until its tests pass |
| K2 — bottom-up, not top-down | The table is read root-to-crown; crown layers cannot be claimed before root layers stabilise |
| K3 — compressed potential, not inert absence | Red CI at L0/L1 is the serpent; green CI is the rising |
| K4 — service is the natural fruit | L9 (Planetary Interface, GAIAN API, governance) is the crown: the system in service to the living Earth |

## Refuse

- Do not treat this map as a dependency graph for CI.
- Do not add runtime assertions that check "chakra alignment".
- Do not claim L4 WASM is implemented because Anāhata maps to it.
- This document does not close #610–#619.
