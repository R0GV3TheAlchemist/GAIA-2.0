# Agent Approval Templates

> These templates standardize the approval requests an AI assistant
> must use when requesting human authorization for repository mutations
> inside GAIA 2.0. Copy-paste the relevant template exactly.
> Conversational text alone — e.g. "go ahead", "looks good", "yes" —
> is **not** a valid approval for a write operation.

## What makes an approval valid

An approval is valid only when:

- The human explicitly approves the **exact** request shown below.
- The `Expected SHA` matches the current branch head at approval time.
- The `Target files` list has not been expanded after the request.
- The approval has not previously been used (single-use).
- The approval has not expired (treat any approval older than the
  current conversation turn as expired).

## What invalidates an existing approval

- The branch HEAD advances (another commit lands).
- The proposed patch is modified after the request is shown.
- The target file set expands beyond what was listed.
- The operation class changes (e.g. from `PUSH_PATCH` to `UPDATE_PR`).
- The human revokes or modifies the approval after giving it.

If any of the above occurs, **discard the approval** and present a new
request.

## Template: MERGE

> ⚠️ **MERGE approval is always separate from patch approval.**
> Approving a `PUSH_PATCH` or `PUSH_CORRECTIVE_PATCH` does **not** imply
> approval to merge. The assistant must always present a distinct MERGE
> request and wait for explicit approval before merging.
