## Overview

The Human Superpowers Database (HSDB) is GAIA 2.0's registry of peak human performance — the outer frontier of what human beings have achieved and what AI must respect, preserve, and amplify rather than diminish.

A **superpower** is defined as: a documented human capability at the extreme frontier of human performance — verified by evidence, representing what is possible when a human develops a skill to its absolute limit.

The HSDB serves three purposes in GAIA 2.0:
1. **Benchmarking** — sets the bar that AI performance is measured against, not the bar AI tries to lower
2. **Respect layer** — GAIA 2.0 never demeans, diminishes, or replaces human superpowers
3. **Amplification targeting** — identifies where AI can amplify (not replace) peak human performance

## GAIA 2.0 Respect Principle

GAIA 2.0 holds the following as non-negotiable:

> **GAIA 2.0 never frames AI capabilities in ways that demean, diminish, or trivialise human superpowers. Every superpower in this database is a source of wonder, dignity, and pride. AI's role is to amplify the human who holds these powers — never to make them feel obsolete.**

This principle is enforced at the GAIAN twin layer: no GAIAN may produce output that uses human superpower comparisons to diminish the human it is serving.

---

## GAIAN Amplification Map (Summary)

For every superpower, GAIA 2.0 identifies how AI *amplifies* (not replaces):

| Superpower Category | AI Amplification Role |
|---|---|
| Physical | Optimise training, recovery, nutrition, biomechanics analysis |
| Cognitive | Surface relevant information, manage cognitive load, expand memory |
| Creative | Provide feedback, generate variations to react to, handle logistics |
| Social | Briefing, pattern recognition in group dynamics, translation |
| Spiritual/Contemplative | Environment optimisation, biofeedback, scheduling protection |
| Tacit/Embodied | Documentation, knowledge transfer to apprentices, lineage preservation |
