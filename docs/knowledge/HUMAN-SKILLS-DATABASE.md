## Overview

The Human Skills Database (HSD) is GAIA 2.0's structured taxonomy of every human-learnable skill. Where the Human Knowledge Database (HKD) captures *what humans know*, the HSD captures *what humans can do* — the applied, practiced, embodied dimension of human capability.

Skills are not knowledge. A surgeon may know anatomy perfectly and still lack the manual dexterity built through 10,000 hours of practice. The HSD models this distinction explicitly, tracking skills from beginner to mastery with proficiency levels, learning pathways, and assessment frameworks.

The HSD integrates directly with:
- **Mi-Memory Framework** ([#644](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/644)) — GAIAN personal skill profiles are stored here
- **Human Knowledge Database** — skills unlock when prerequisite knowledge domains are loaded
- **Human Superpowers Database** ([HUMAN-SUPERPOWERS-DATABASE.md](./HUMAN-SUPERPOWERS-DATABASE.md)) — mastery-tier skills connect to documented peak human performance
- **AI-Human Complementarity Map** ([AI-HUMAN-COMPLEMENTARITY-MAP.md](./AI-HUMAN-COMPLEMENTARITY-MAP.md)) — every skill maps to its AI augmentation potential

---

## Skill Identifier Schema

Every skill follows the same canonical ID format as the knowledge catalog:

```
{audience}.{plane}.{category}.{slug}
```

| Field | Value | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `audience` | `hum` | `hum` |
| `plane` | `skill` | `skill` |
| `category` | kebab-case category name | `cognitive` |
| `slug` | kebab-case skill name | `critical-thinking` |

**Full example:** `hum.skill.cognitive.critical-thinking`

---

## Skill Node Schema

Every skill in the HSD is a structured node:

```json
{
  "id": "hum.skill.cognitive.critical-thinking",
  "title": "Critical Thinking",
  "slug": "critical-thinking",
  "category": "cognitive",
  "description": "The ability to analyse information objectively, identify logical fallacies, evaluate evidence, and form well-reasoned judgements.",
  "knowledge_prerequisites": [
    "hum.know.basic.basic-logic-and-reasoning",
    "hum.know.basic.basic-critical-thinking"

    { "level": 4, "label": "Proficient", "description": "Applies Socratic method; evaluates competing frameworks" },
    { "level": 5, "label": "Mastery", "description": "Operates at the frontier of epistemic rigour; teaches the skill" }
  ],

    "Practice Socratic questioning in daily conversations",
    "Analyse and deconstruct 100 real-world arguments",
    "Study cognitive biases and practice bias detection",
    "Teach critical thinking to others"
  ],
  "assessment_method": "Argument analysis exercises; logical fallacy identification tests; structured debate performance",
  "ai_augmentation": "AI can surface counterarguments, fact-check claims in real-time, and map argument structure — but the human judgement call remains human",
  "ai_replicable": false,
  "superpower_ceiling": "hum.superpower.cognitive.master-debater",
  "tacit_component": "high",
  "version": "1.0.0",

## Proficiency Level Framework

All skills use a universal 5-level proficiency ladder:

| Level | Label | General Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Beginner** | Aware of the skill; can perform basic elements with guidance |
| 2 | **Developing** | Can perform independently in simple, familiar contexts |
| 3 | **Competent** | Reliable performance across standard contexts; adapts to variation |
| 4 | **Proficient** | High performance in complex contexts; can teach others |
| 5 | **Mastery** | Operates at the frontier; recognised expert; pushes the skill forward |

Level 5 Mastery connects to the **Human Superpowers Database** where documented peak performers represent the outer edge of what is humanly possible.

## Learning Pathway Engine

The Learning Pathway Engine generates structured, personalised paths to skill mastery for any GAIAN twin. Given a target skill and current proficiency level, it returns:

1. **Knowledge prerequisites** to load first (from HKD)
2. **Skill prerequisites** to develop first (from HSD)
3. **Ordered learning steps** from current level to target level
4. **Practice resources** linked to authoritative sources
5. **Assessment checkpoints** with measurable outcomes
6. **AI augmentation tools** available at each stage
7. **Estimated time investment** based on documented learning research

The engine is powered by the Graphiti knowledge graph traversal layer, resolving all dependency chains before generating the pathway.

## GAIAN Skill Profile Integration

Every GAIAN twin maintains a personal Skill Profile stored in the Mi-Memory Framework ([#644](https://github.com/R0GV3TheAlchemist/GAIA-2.0/issues/644)):

```json
{
  "gaian_id": "did:gaia:twin:abc123",
  "skill_profile": [
    {
      "skill_id": "hum.skill.cognitive.critical-thinking",
      "proficiency_level": 3,
      "last_assessed": "2026-09-01",
      "learning_pathway_active": true,
      "next_milestone": "Complete 100 argument analyses"
    }
  ]
}
```

Skill profiles are private by default. GAIANs may choose to share specific skills publicly or with specific communities.
