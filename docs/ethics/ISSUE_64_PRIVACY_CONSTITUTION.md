This is law. It does not study the Wizard. Default is refuse.

## Ten principles

1. **Consent.** Granular, current, revocable. No implied ingest.
2. **Local-default.** Data stays on the Gaian's machine unless they share it.
3. **Biometric sovereignty.** Face, body, voice, and health signals are not training fuel.
4. **User-held keys.** The Gaian holds keys. GAIA does not keep a silent copy.
5. **Deletion.** Revoke means cryptographic erasure or equivalent wipe, not a hide flag.
6. **Transparency.** Purpose, retention, and processors are disclosed in plain language.
7. **Purpose limitation.** Collected for X cannot be reused for Y without a new grant.
8. **Non-weaponization.** No targeting, scoring, or sale to insurers, employers, or advertisers.
9. **Equity.** Protections do not weaken by class, race, disability, or nation.
10. **Child protection.** Under 16: guardian consent, no profiling, no health-twin learning, no Phase 3 personality learning.

## Age-gate

- Under 16 requires verifiable guardian consent.
- No behavioral profiling of children.
- No health-twin learning on children.
- Child path cannot enable Phase 3 personality learning.
- Aligns with issue 221: no Level 2+ agency, no ambient listen.

## Forbidden

- Third-party likeness without that person's consent
- Hidden copies
- Insurer or employer health export
