# PROOF-CANON-GOV-AMENDMENT-001

**Author:** Kyle Steen (`R0GV3TheAlchemist`)
**Canon:** Tablet Amendment Protocol
**Type:** procedural
**Status:** verified
**Method:** semver consistency audit + immutability verification
**Date:** 2026-09-23

## Method

Verification that the amendment protocol defined in
`docs/canon/AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md` is internally consistent, that its
semver rules are correctly adapted from software versioning conventions
to document versioning, and that its immutability constraints preserve
the binding nature of sealed tablets.

## Results

- Linked doctrine: `docs/canon/AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md`
- Semver adaptation (patch / minor / major) confirmed as consistent with
  standard semantic versioning semantics:
  - Patch: non-semantic change — correct
  - Minor: additive, non-contradictory change — correct
  - Major: change that alters meaning or contradicts existing content — correct
- Elevated justification rule (200-word rationale for Major amendments to
  Stage 7 / Coagulation tablets) is proportionate and clearly scoped
- Immutable fields (Canon Number, Sealed date, file path) are the minimum
  necessary set to preserve tablet identity and history traceability
- Deprecation procedure is distinct from amendment and correctly scoped
  to supersession rather than correction
- Amendment Checklist (7 items) is copy-pasteable and internally consistent
  with the Sealing Ceremony checklist in `SEALING_CEREMONY.md`

## Law encoded

C77. A canon that cannot be amended is brittle; a canon that can be amended
arbitrarily is not canon. The amendment protocol holds both truths: change
is permitted, but every change is versioned, justified, and traceable to
the original sealed work.
