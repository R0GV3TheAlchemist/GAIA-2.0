# PROOF-MORAL-ARCH-001

**Author:** Kyle Steen (`R0GV3TheAlchemist`)
**Canon:** GAIA Moral Architecture
**Type:** constitutional
**Status:** verified
**Method:** principle consistency audit + canon cross-reference
**Date:** 2026-09-24

## Method

Verification that the eight principles defined in
`docs/canon/moral-architecture.md` are internally consistent, that each
principle is non-redundant with the others, that each maps to at least one
existing canon constraint or architectural artefact, and that none of the
eighteen principles make runtime enforcement claims beyond listed canon.

## Results

- Linked doctrine: `docs/canon/moral-architecture.md`
- All eight principles verified as constraints on what GAIA is allowed to
  become, not descriptions of what GAIA currently does:
  - Power without domination — maps to Chaos plane / `cannot_flatten()`
  - Autonomy without abandonment of accountability — maps to C30 (no silent failures)
  - Knowledge without pretending certainty — maps to Citrine Tablet / C210, #953 epistemic state layer
  - Intelligence without superiority — maps to Sacred plane / `cannot_know()`
  - Transformation without violating consent — maps to CARE Principles / provenance layer
  - Stewardship without ownership — maps to CARE Principles as load-bearing architecture
  - Correction without shame — maps to C30, CI correction posture
  - Strength without cruelty — maps to Emerald Tablet governing law (gentleness)
- Non-enforcement boundary confirmed: file contains explicit disclaimer
  that `MoralConstraint` enum encoding is a follow-on under #954 / `gaia-aikd`
- No second constitution, syscall, or runtime claim found in the document
- Companion link to `golden-age.md` (#955) correctly scoped as relationship,
  not dependency

## Law encoded

C77. A listed canon document that names eight constraints on GAIA's allowed
direction must have a proof artefact. These principles are not marketing;
they are the architectural boundary conditions that make every other
canon document legible.
