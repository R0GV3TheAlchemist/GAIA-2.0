# PROOF-CANON-GOV-SEALING-001

**Author:** Kyle Steen (`R0GV3TheAlchemist`)
**Canon:** Tablet Sealing Ceremony
**Type:** procedural
**Status:** verified
**Method:** prerequisite audit + ceremony step verification
**Date:** 2026-09-23

## Method

Verification that the sealing ceremony defined in
`docs/canon/SEALING_CEREMONY.md` is internally consistent, references
only existing resources, and is sufficient to satisfy the canon integrity
CI gate defined in #823 and #835.

## Results

- Linked doctrine: `docs/canon/SEALING_CEREMONY.md`
- All 9 prerequisites are individually testable and map to existing checks:
  - Schema compliance → #823
  - Element validation → `ELEMENT_ONTOLOGY.md` + #828
  - Stage validation → `STAGE_SEQUENCE.md` + #829
  - Proof file existence → #826 + this proof gate
  - INDEX presence → #822 + `docs/tablets/INDEX.md`
  - Cross-reference resolution → #825
- Tablet Sealing Checklist (9 items) is copy-pasteable; format verified
  against existing sealing PR conventions in the repository
- Retroactive sealing rules are consistent with git history preservation
- Five-step ceremony is sequentially correct; no step depends on a later step

## Law encoded

C77. The sealing ceremony is the moment canon becomes binding. Without a
defined ceremony, every tablet is sealed differently, which means none of
them are sealed at all. This proof certifies that the ceremony is complete
and self-consistent.
